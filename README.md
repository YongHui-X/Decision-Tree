# Decision Tree Analysis

This repository contains an implementation and analysis of a Decision Tree model for classification tasks.

## Overview

A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions.  

In this project, we performed preprocessing and trained a Decision Tree to evaluate its performance on a dataset.

## Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Model Training

- Implemented a Decision Tree classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score
- Accuracy achieved: **0.85**

## Visualization

The trained Decision Tree is visualised to understand its decision-making process:
